# TODO

- Build a tool that can take all historic observations and reprocess them to 
  add columns for all current metrics, and do unit conversion (if applicable)
  to fill in missing data.
- Add tooling to rebuild aggregations.
- Import old historical data I still have lying around, esp 
  humidity/dewpoint for the years that's missing, if I have it.
- Build climate pages for:
  - Calendar Day (i.e. June 5th; which would include all June 5 data 
    recorded historically) 
  - Month
  - Year
  - All Time
